# X12-Git-Collaboration
Exercise Nov 9

## Hello! I'm making changes to a README.md FILE!


### Uh oh!
I dont have a partner for this project :( please still give a good grade lol

I am making another change now. This is change # 2!!!
# :)

This is the third change on the document. I am getting familiar with git clone, add ., commit -m "whatever", and git push...

...Slowly I am losing motivation
